# PRODIGY_WD_05 â€“ Weather Web Application

This project is part of my **Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
It is a responsive **Weather Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with API integration for real-time weather updates.

- **City Auto-Suggestions** â€“ Search box with instant suggestions via OpenWeatherMap Geo API
- **Weather Icons** â€“ Animated icons for different weather conditions
- **Responsive UI** â€“ Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
